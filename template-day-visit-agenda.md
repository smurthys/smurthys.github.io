A "day visit" has a few common activities. The activities are listed here in their typical order, 
but they may be reordered to suit schedules. A typical visit takes 6-8 hours if it involves all 
the listed activities.

PS: This is just a template agenda. Hosts should customize it to their goals.

1.	Arrival: 15 minutes. Rendezvous with hosting department's head. Give the guest a safe place 
    to put their things. 
    
    (If the guest spends a good amount of time on campus, it is common to give them the use of an
    office/room for the day. If a room cannot be provided, at least provide them some space where
    they can take a call in private or be by themselves for a few minutes in between activities).
    
2.	Meet institutional leadership: 30-45 minutes. Typical people present are deans, principal, director, 
    provost, and so on depending on organizational structure and availability. The idea is to exchange 
    perspectives and notes on directions, trends, and priorities at strategic institutional level.

3.	Campus tour: 30-45 minutes. An appointed student from the host department takes the guest to key 
    locations on campus. If the campus is too large, focus on landmarks specific/related to the host department.

4.	Meet host faculty: 45-60 minutes. Typically the entire faculty of the host department(s). The 
    goal is to freely and informally exchange perspectives and notes on trends and priorities in
    teaching and research as well as improving student engagement at both curricular and co-curricular
    levels.

5.	Guest lecture: 90 minutes including preparation (setup laptop, check Wi-Fi and projector, etc.).
    Typically the lecture is open to all, but at leasr the host faculty and appropriate portion of the
    student body attend.

6.	“Ask Me Anything”: 30-45-60 minutes, length adjusted on-the-fly depending on delays and scheduling issues.
    An open session where students (and faculty) ask the guest relevant questions on any topic in the discipline,
    NOT (necessarily) related to the topic of the just-concluded lecture. Most questions will be from students
    and tend to be about further education, employment opportunities, emerging technologies, etc.

7.	One-on-one meet with selected students/teams: 45-60 minutes, 3-4 students/teams, 15-20 minutes per
    student/team. Host faculty select 3-4 students/teams who they feel can particularly benefit from 
    the one-one opportunity. Students are free to discuss any topic, but they should be advised to make
    the most of the opportunity to put forth their pressing questions. Students should also be advised that
    they should make sure the guest has sufficient time to answer students’ questions. (Students tend to
    ramble and lose track of time, especially if a team wishes to discuss a term project or such).

8.	Departure: 15 minutes. The host department head and some of the institutional leadership get together
    with the guest briefly to bid goodbye.
