I engage students, faculty, and administrators of schools, colleges, and universities worldwide.
The engagement can be short term (like a day visit) or long term. It can be in the form of workshops,
tutorials, guest lectures, open forums ("Ask me Anything"), consulting, and one-on-one sessions.

I am able to customize faculty development, curriculum development, strategic planning, and similar
activities to specific departmental and institutional needs.

I take all engagments--small or large--seriously. My overarching goal is to improve the quality of
education and to add meaningful academic value. I am firnly committed to this cause and will collaborate
with anyone similarly committed.

I humbly and respectfully welcome inquiries from people and institutions who share my vision and values
on improving education and through that building a better society.

Finally, over the years, I have come to believe that a successful engagement has both support and participation
from institutional leaders (dean, principal, director, provost, and so on depending on the organizational
structure). Thus, I generally entertain inquiries only from insitutions where the leadership demonstrably
understands and promotes the value of the engagement. (I do make exceptions.)


### Engagement Process

Much of this section is for institutions outside the USA. (The US structure is quite different.)

I strongly recommend that the head/chair of the host department (typically Computer Science or Information
Science) or someone in institutional leadership be the sole contact person for all communication with me. 
Regardless, the contact should be someone with the position and influence within the institution to coordinate,
plan, and execute the engagement. They will also need sufficient knowledge of the academic portion of the
engagement. For example, they should be familiar with academic schemes and syllabi if organizing a guest lecture
to students.

**Typical engagement process:**

1. An informal mail or call from a department head or a person in institutional leadership introducing
   themselves, expressing interest, and inquiring availability. Alternatively, this interaction may take place
   with an "event coordinator".
2. A formal invitation to me by mail with a broad statement on the nature of engagement. 
3. Exchange mails or calls with me to determine the exact nature of engagement. 
4. Develop and share with me a plan and agenda for the engagement.
5. Advertise the engagement with appropriate audience: students, faculty, and administrators.
6. Make logistical arrangements.
7. Execute the engagement.
8. Evaluate the engagement: success or failure, how could it have been better, potential future engagements, and so on. 


### Logistics

The host institution needs to arrange transportation to and from my homebase in the country. I 
will not have the time or familiarity to arrange transportation on my own.

I will bring my own computer and phone, but I will need Internet connection for both devices. If 
I make a presentation (say a guest lecture), I will also need an external HDMI or USB-C monitor,
an external USB keyboard and mouse, and a clean whiteboard for impromptu use. I assume the 
external monitor will be shared to an overhead projector. 

(I need an external monitor to see my own presentation without craning my neck at the projector
screen. I use my computer's screen to view my own private notes and scripts during the presentation.)

I do not take any food or drink during a day visit: not even coffee or tea or milk. I have no 
problem with other people consuming food and drinks in any meeting or activity I participate, 
but I ask I not be pressured to partake. I will let the host know if my requirements change. 

**I would like good, clean drinking water** during the visit.


### Day visits

A "day visit" is the most common form of engagement and frequently takes place when I am already 
visiting the country.

A day visit typically lasts between four and eight hours. It often involves meet with faculty, 
a guest lecture, and an open forum ("Ask me Anything"). In general, I do not entertain a campus
visit with just a guest lecture and nothing else because it has too much overhead in terms of
transportation and my own preparation. Thus, I humbly request that hosts plan an agenda that is
worthy of everyone's time and effort. (See a template non-binding agenda for a day visit.)

I generally do not expect [honorarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorarium) for a day visit,
but it is appreciated. It is important to clarify that I entertain day visits for intellectual 
satisfaction. I spend any honoraria I receive on engagement-related activities and to help deserving
students. 

(The engagements are NOT a profit-making or resume-enhancing exercise for me.)


### Topics

The following is a shortlist of topics for presentation to **CS undergraduate** students and 
faculty. The topics are based on student and faculty feedback on what they find helpful. I am 
happy to consider other topics in which I have sufficient expertise. (I will assist in finding
the right speaker if I do not have expertise in the desired topic.)

#### Term Projects

I entertain students for term projects. To assure quality, I am quite selective about both
projects and students. My participation in projects is serious and I expect students to be
equally invested, be genuinely interested in learning all parts of project management, and
practice "social coding". Bottom line, the projects are not "resume enhancement" exercises.

Students typically work on parts of one of my ongoing projects. I am open to new project ideas
in areas of my interest. It's unlikely I will be interested in projects about buzzwords.

During the project, students will experience first-hand all aspects of project/product management
using many of the same tools and processes used in the industry. Students who complete projects
under me generally become preferred candidates with many employers, and practically all students
attribute their success in finding and maintaining jobs to the overall experience. These levels
of achievement are possible only with discipline and commitment on the part of both the students
and myself.

Interested students should speak with their admins and faculty, and have them send me
strong recommendations. Naturally, to accept recommendations, I need to already have a
working relationship with the recommender. If a relationship does not exist, engaging me for
one or more talks at the college is a common way to start the relationship.

#### Contact

I encourage direct messages on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@smurthys). 

Most faculty and administrators get my mail address or phone number from mutual friends or from people
in institutions that have already engaged me. People sometimes also make first contact on [social media](/).

**PS**: If you have my e-mail address, I respectfully ask you not share it with others without
first checking with me. I receive high volume of mails and like to avoid somehow not noticing 
genuine e-mails and the senders feeling ignored. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
