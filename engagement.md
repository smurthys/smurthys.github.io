I engage students, faculty, and administrators of schools, colleges, and universities worldwide.
The engagement can be short term (like a day visit) or long term. It can be in the form of workshops,
tutorials, guest lectures, open forums ("Ask me Anything"), consulting, one-on-one sessions, mentoring,
and project guidance.

I am able to customize faculty development, curriculum development, strategic planning, and similar
activities to specific departmental and institutional needs.

I take all engagments—small and large—seriously. My goal is to improve the quality of education 
and to add meaningful academic value. I am firmly committed to this cause and will collaborate
with anyone similarly committed. To this end, I humbly welcome inquiries from people and institutions
that share my vision and values so that together we can build a better society.

I respectfully ask potential hosts to **read this page carefully in its entirety prior to starting the
engagement process** as it is designed to answer upfront as many questions as possible and to address
frequent issues.


### Engagement Process

Much of this section is for institutions outside the USA. (The US structure is quite different.)

I strongly recommend that the **head of the host department** (typically Computer Science or Information
Science) or **someone in institutional leadership** be the sole contact person for all communication
about the engagement. The contact person should have the position and influence within the institution
to coordinate, plan, and execute the engagement. They will also need sufficient knowledge of the academic
portion of the engagement. For example, they should be familiar with academic catalog/scheme and syllabi
if organizing a guest lecture or workshop.

I recommend the engagement have **institutional support** because it adds "gravity" to the engagement, 
which in turn boosts participation. While I am happy to engage any audience, appropriate organization,
advertisement, and participation are key factors in my own satisfaction from the engagement. They are
also a way to recognize and reciprocate my effort.

I appreciate professional communication with the host, including them carefully reading my messages, 
promptly replying to messages, and appraising me early of any issues with planning or executing the
engagement.

I strongly recommend that hosts finalize the agenda for the engagement at least one week prior to when
the engagement actually takes place. I try to be flexible, but I like to avoid feeling pressured or 
having to pressure someone.


**Typical engagement process:**

1. An informal mail or call from a department head or a person in institutional leadership introducing
   themselves, expressing interest, and inquiring availability. In some countries, this initial interaction
   could take place with my "event coordinator".
3. A formal invitation to me by mail with a broad statement on the nature of engagement.
   Please specify target audience: students only, faculty only, administrators only, or a combination.
4. Exchange mails or calls with me to determine the exact nature of engagement. It is quite common for the
   final engagement to be (quite) different from the initial thought, and that is OK.
5. Develop and share with me a plan and agenda for the engagement. Please note that the plan/agenda needs
   to be specific about time windows for each activity and the purpose for each activity. **I am unable to
   work with agendas with placeholders items** such as "guest lecture", "faculty meeting", etc.
6. Advertise the engagement to appropriate audience: students, faculty, and administrators. 
   **A link to my picture is in the Contact section on this page**.
7. Make logistical arrangements for the visit. Please see the Logistics section on this page.
9. Execute the engagement.
10. Evaluate the engagement: whether the engagent was a success or a failure, how could it have been better,
    potential future engagements, and so on.

I send the host links to pre-event and post-event surveys as part of the evaluation. The host should promptly
broadcast the survey to the target audience and ensure that prospective/actual participants complete the survey
in timely fashion.


### Logistics

**Local transportation:** The host institution needs to arrange transportation to and from my homebase 
in the country. I will not have the time or familiarity to arrange transportation on my own. The 
transportation should be safe, clean, and reasonably efficient and comfortable because I like to 
arrive on campus without anxiety or perspiration. And, respectfully, no "cheapest car for hire" please.
Also, definitely no 2-wheelers. (Yes, sadly, those things have happened.)

**Lodging:** The host needs to arrange safe, clean, and reasonably comfortable lodging if the visit 
spans multiple days, or if the situation makes a same-day return to my homebase unsafe or impractical
in some way.

**Food:** I do **not** take any food or beverage during a day visit: not even coffee, tea, or milk. 
I do not mind other people consuming food and beverage in my presence, but I ask not to be pressured 
to partake. I will inform the host if my requirements change.

**I would like safe drinking water** during the visit. If it is not an inconvenience, I would also 
appreciate some fresh-squeezed lemon juice (just the juice from one lemon with **nothing added**), some table salt
separate from the lemon juice, a spoon, and a drinking cup. But, just plain water suffices if lemon juice, etc.
is a problem.

**Internet:** I generally bring my own computer and phone, but I will need wireless Internet connection 
for both devices throughout my stay.

**Peripherals:** I will need the following peripherals if I make a presentation (which I almost always do):
* An overhead projector connected to my computer using host-provided adaptor/dongle
* An external monitor and an appropriate adaptor/dongle, mirroring the overhead projector
* An external keyboard and a mouse
* A clean whiteboard, markers in multiple colors, and an eraser (all for impromptu illustrations)

Please strive to provide an external monitor that is mirrored to the overhead projector so that I can
see my own presentation without craning my neck at the projector screen. I like to use my computer's 
builtin screen to privately view my notes and scripts related to the presentation.

**Ports:** My computer has one HDMI port and one free USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port. Hosts often connect an
external monitor to my computer's HDMI port and mirror the monitor to the overhead projector. (This is also
a typical US classroom setup.)

My computer has just one USB-A connector. So, a USB hub will almost certainly be required to connect
both an external keyboard and a mouse.

I **cannot** part with my computer, provide my computer's password, or allow others to use my computer
without my supervision. I also cannot install custom software or change security settings to complete
any part of the engagement. However, I am happy to arrive early to check that my computer plays well
with the host environment.

**Recording:** No audio or video recording of any part of my engagement without my prior explicit 
approval. Obviously, people do take pictures during presentation and generally throughout the engagement,
but no pictures of slides and other material (projected or otherwise).

I do like seeing pictures and videos taken during the engagement. So, please feel free to share them 
(or links to them).

### Day visits

A "day visit" is the most common form of engagement and frequently takes place when I am already 
visiting the country.

A day visit lasts between four and eight hours and often involves a meet with faculty, a guest 
lecture, an open forum ("Ask me Anything"), and a meet with institutional leadership. Unless I
have a personal/prior connection to the host, I do not entertain visits that do not include a
genuine meeting with institutional leadership (at least departmental leadership).

In general, **I do not entertain a visit with just a guest lecture and nothing else** because it 
has too much overhead in terms of transportation and my own preparation. Thus, I humbly ask that 
hosts plan an agenda that is worthy of everyone's time and effort. 
(See a [template non-binding agenda](/day-visit-agenda-template).)

I generally do not expect [honorarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorarium) for a day visit,
but appreciate it and accept it as a token of respect. It is important to clarify that I entertain 
day visits for intellectual satisfaction. I spend any honoraria I receive on engagement-related
activities and to help deserving students.

I do expect honorarium if I make multiple visits or a multiple-day visit, or if the engagement 
involves workshop, tutorial, faculty-specific activities, or any "intensive activity".

(Day visits are NOT a profit-making or résumé-enhancing exercise for me.)


### Topics

The following is a shortlist of topics for presentation to **CS undergraduate** students and 
faculty. The topics are based on student and faculty feedback on what they find helpful. I am 
happy to consider other topics in which I have sufficient expertise. (I will assist in finding
the right speaker if I do not have expertise in the desired topic.)

Please inquire for topics exclusive to graduate students (Masters and PhD). Many of the topics
listed also work for graduate students with attention to deeper technical aspects. Some of the
listed topics are actually graduate-only as noted under pre-requisites.

Pre-university engagement is rare, but I am generally able to engage on any topic the students
and faculty wish.

PS: At first glance, it might seem like the prescribed undergraduate curriculum already covers
some of the topics listed. However, my presentations cover **modern material** and discuss 
several finer aspects the curriculum does not. Also, presentations include real-life examples
and employ **modern tools and processes**. They also include **thought-provoking** exercises
for the audience, and I even provide feedback to anyone who sends me their solutions after
the event.

Rest assured I carefully select topics and am confident they add significant educational
value. (I am open to public review of my material to test this assertion.) I humbly advise
against brushing off the topics just because the title words are similar to those in
curricular topics. At least, check with me prior to forming an opinion.

#### Term Projects

I entertain students for term projects. To assure quality, I am quite selective about both
projects and students. My participation in projects is serious and I expect students to be
equally invested, be genuinely interested in learning all parts of project management, and
practice "social coding". Bottom line, the projects are not "resume enhancement" exercises.

Students typically work on parts of one of my ongoing projects. I am open to new project ideas
in areas of my interest. It's unlikely I will be interested in projects about buzzwords.

During the project, students will experience first-hand all aspects of project/product management
using many of the same tools and processes used in the industry. Students who complete projects
under me generally become preferred candidates with many employers, and practically all students
attribute their success in finding and maintaining jobs to the overall experience. These levels
of achievement are possible only with discipline and commitment on the part of both the students
and myself.

Interested students should speak with their admins and faculty, and have them send me
strong recommendations. Naturally, to accept recommendations, I need to already have a
working relationship with the recommender. If a relationship does not exist, engaging me for
one or more talks at the institution is a common way to start the relationship.

#### Contact

Most faculty and administrators get my mail address or phone number from mutual friends or from people
in institutions that have already engaged me. People sometimes also make first contact on [social media](/#social).

If contacting on social media, especially students, I encourage direct messages on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@smurthys).

Here is a [picture of me](/images/BSSVCUPDN.jpg) that should be good for use in flyers and such.
Please contact me if you have difficulty accessing it.

**PS**: If you have my e-mail address, I respectfully ask you not share it with others without
first checking with me. I receive high volume of mails and like to avoid somehow not noticing 
genuine e-mails and the senders feeling ignored. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
