I frequently speak to students and faculty at engineering schools and universities, as well as upper-level
high schools ("pre university" in India). I also provide faculty development.

The following is a shortlist of topics for presentation to **CS undergraduate** students and faculty.
The topics are based on student and faculty feedback on what they find helpful. I am happy
to consider other topics in which I have sufficient expertise. (I am happy to find the right
speaker if I do not have expertise in the desired topic.)


#### C++

#### Professional development 

These topics are open to and recommended for students in all engineering branches; not just for CS students.

Git, GitHub | No particular requirement
Social coding | Introductory software engineering
Teams and ethics | Introductory software engineering
Markdown documentation | No particular requirement
Building static websites | Markdown, 4th semester or later


#### Term Projects

I entertain students for term projects. To assure quality, I am quite selective about both
projects and students. My participation in projects is serious and I expect students to be
equally invested, be genuinely interested in learning all parts of project management, and
practice "social coding". Bottom line, the projects are not "resume enhancement" exercises.

Students typically work on parts of one of my ongoing projects. I am open to new project ideas
in areas of my interest. It's unlikely I will be interested in projects about buzzwords.

During the project, students will experience first-hand all aspects of project/product management
using many of the same tools and processes used in the industry. Students who complete projects
under me generally become preferred candidates with many employers, and practically all students
attribute their success in finding and maintaining jobs to the overall experience. These levels
of achievement are possible only with discipline and commitment on the part of both the students
and myself.

Interested students should speak with their admins and faculty, and have them send me
strong recommendations. Naturally, to accept recommendations, I need to already have a
working relationship with the recommender. If a relationship does not exist, engaging me for
one or more talks at the college is a common way to start the relationship.

#### Contact

I encourage students and faculty to follow and message me directly on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@smurthys).
Faculty and admins will quite likely also have my e-mail address and may e-mail me directly.
