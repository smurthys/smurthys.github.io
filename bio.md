I am a teacher, researcher, and technologist. I am the founder and Director of Data Systems & Solutions
Lab \([DASSL](https://dassl.github.io),
read _dazzle_\) and the Founder and Moderator of Special Interest Group on C++ \([SIGCPP](https://sigcpp.github.io)\). 
I am also a Principal Researcher at The Else Institute (returned to a former position).

Prior to my return to The Else Institute, I was a member of the Computer Science faculty at the University of Texas, Dallas and
before that tenured in the Department of Computer Science at Western Connecticut State University. In these roles, in addition to
teaching and researching Computer Science, I worked with students on co-curricular projects in modern software and data engineering.

Before joining Western, I was the Executive Director of and a Principal Researcher at The Else Institute. Prior to that, I setup and
directed the Applied Research group at Wipro Technologies. Prior to Wipro, I founded Sunlet Software Systems, in Portland, Oregon,
where I created tools for software-engineering activities such as defect management and configuration management. Prior to that, I
designed international trade-finance systems at Tiger Systems in New York for use at banks such as Citibank, Chase, and Barclays.

I have taught graduate and undergraduate courses in data management and software engineering at Oregon Health & Science University and
at Oregon Institute of Technology. I have published, organized, and chaired international conferences and workshops, and have been an
invited speaker at venues such as the British Royal Society, IBM Research, and Microsoft.

I have also provided consulting services on technology, techno-legal, and techno-financial matters to corporations and governments: I
was the chief architect of Automated Pickup Services at Federal Express. I led the development of India’s national policy for IT
integration of the Indian Rupee sign; have advised clients on developing, prosecuting, and defending patents; have conducted discovery
and audit in legal and financial matters; and have testified in judicial proceedings.

I am now, or have been, associated with key professional organizations in Computer Science,
Service Science, and Web Science: Association for Computing Machinery \(ACM\), ACM Special Interest 
Group on Management of Data \(SIGMOD\), Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\), IEEE Computer Society, Service Research and Innovation
Institute \(SRII\), and Web Science Trust (WST). I was a senior adviser to SRII and the
Founding President of its India chapter. I was also the first Industry Liaison at WST.

I have a PhD \(CS\) from Portland State University and a Masters \(CS, Data Intensive Systems\) from
Oregon Health & Science University. My current research interests include software engineering, 
data engineering, analytics, e-discovery, and forensics. I am particularly interested in software 
and data architecture for cloud-based high-performance systems.
