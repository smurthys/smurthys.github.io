I am a teacher, researcher, and technologist. I am the founder of Data Science & Systems Lab \([DASSL](https://dassl.github.io),
read _dazzle_\) and the Special Interest Group on C++ \([SIGCPP](https://sigcpp.github.io)\). I am also an Associate Professor
of Instruction in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Dallas at Texas.

Until recently, I was an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Western Connecticut State University, where
in addition to teaching and researching Computer Science, I worked with students on several co-curricular projects in modern software
and data engineering.

Before joining Western, I was the Executive Director of and a Principal Researcher at The Else Institute. Prior to that, I setup and
directed the Applied Research group at Wipro Technologies. Prior to Wipro, I founded Sunlet Software Systems, in Portland, Oregon,
where I created tools for software-engineering activities such as defect management and configuration management. Prior to that, I
designed international trade-finance sys­tems at Tiger Systems in New York for use at banks such as Citibank, Chase, and Barclays.

I have taught graduate and undergraduate courses in data management and software engineering at Oregon Health & Science University and
at Oregon Institute of Technology. I have published, organized, and chaired international conferences and workshops, and have been an
invited speaker at venues such as the British Royal Society, IBM Research, and Microsoft.

I have also provided consulting services on technology, techno-legal, and techno-financial matters to corporations and governments: I
was the chief architect of Automated Pickup Services at Federal Express. I led the development of India’s national policy for IT
integration of the Indian Rupee sign; have advised clients on developing, prosecuting, and defending patents; have conducted discovery
and audit in legal and financial matters; and have testified in judicial proceedings.

I am now, or have been, associated with key professional organizations in Computer Science, Service Science, and Web Science. I am a
member of Association for Computing Machinery \(ACM\), ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data \(SIGMOD\), Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\), and IEEE Computer Society. I was a senior adviser to the Service Research and
Innovation Institute \(SRII\) and the Founding President of its India chapter. I was also the first Industry Liaison at the Web
Science Trust.

I have a PhD \(CS\) from Portland State University and a Masters \(CS, Data Intensive Systems\) from Oregon Health & Science
University. My current research interests include software engineering, analytics, e-discovery, and forensics. I am particularly
interested in software and data architecture for cloud-based high-performance systems.
