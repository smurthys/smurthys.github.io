I engage students, faculty, and administrators of schools, colleges, and universities worldwide.
The engagement can be short term (like a day visit) or long term. It can be in the form of workshops,
tutorials, guest lectures, open forums ("Ask me Anything"), consulting, one-on-one sessions, mentoring,
and project guidance.

I am able to customize faculty development, curriculum development, strategic planning, and similar
activities to specific departmental and institutional needs.

I take all engagments—small and large—seriously. My goal is to improve the quality of education 
and to add meaningful academic value. I am firmly committed to this cause and will collaborate
with anyone similarly committed. To this end, I humbly welcome inquiries from people and institutions
that share my vision and values so that together we can build a better society.

I respectfully ask potential hosts to **carefully read this page and the pages linked below in their
entirety prior to starting the engagement process**. The pages are designed to answer upfront as
many questions as possible and to address/avoid frequent issues.
