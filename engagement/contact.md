## Engagement: Contact

Most faculty and administrators obtain my mail address or phone number from mutual friends or from people
in institutions I have already visited. People sometimes also make first contact on [social media](/#social).

If contacting on social media, especially students, I encourage direct messages on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@smurthys).

**My name**: My legal first name is "Sudarshan", but I go by "Sean". Here is "Sean" approximately in
selected Indian languages. Let me know if any of these translations are incorrect or if you have entries
for other languages (Indian or non-Indian):

शान (Hindi), ಶಾನ್ (Kannada), శాన్ (Telugu), ஷான் (Tamil), ഷാൻ (Malayalam).

**Picture:** Here is a [picture of me](/images/BSSVCUPDN.jpg) that should be good for use in flyers 
and such. Contact me if you have difficulty accessing it.

**PS**: If you have my e-mail address, I respectfully ask you not share it with others without
first checking with me. I receive high volume of mails and like to avoid a situation of not noticing 
genuine e-mails and the senders feeling ignored. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
