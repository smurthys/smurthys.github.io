## Engagement: Contact

Most faculty and administrators obtain my mail address or phone number from mutual friends or from people
in institutions that have already engaged me. People sometimes also make first contact on [social media](/#social).

If contacting on social media, especially students, I encourage direct messages on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@smurthys).

Here is a [picture of me](/images/BSSVCUPDN.jpg) that should be good for use in flyers and such.
Please contact me if you have difficulty accessing it.

**PS**: If you have my e-mail address, I respectfully ask you not share it with others without
first checking with me. I receive high volume of mails and like to avoid somehow not noticing 
genuine e-mails and the senders feeling ignored. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
