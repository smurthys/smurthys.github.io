## Engagement: Topics

The following is a shortlist of topics for presentation to **CS undergraduate** students and/or 
faculty. The topics are based on student and faculty feedback on what they find helpful. I am 
happy to consider other topics in which I have sufficient expertise. (I will assist in finding
the right speaker if I do not have expertise in the desired topic.)

Please inquire for topics exclusive to graduate students (Masters and PhD). Many of the topics
listed also work for graduate students with attention to deeper technical aspects. Some of the
listed topics are actually graduate-only as noted under pre-requisites.

Pre-university engagement is rare, but I am generally able to engage on any topic the students
and faculty wish.

PS: At first glance, it might seem like the prescribed undergraduate curriculum already covers
some of the topics listed. However, my presentations cover **modern material** and discuss 
several finer aspects the curriculum does not. Also, presentations include real-life examples
and employ **modern tools and processes**. They also include **thought-provoking** exercises
for the audience, and I even provide feedback to anyone who sends me their solutions after
the event.

Rest assured I carefully select topics and am confident they add significant educational
value. (I am open to public review of my material to test this assertion.) I humbly advise
against brushing off the topics just because the title words are similar to those in
curricular topics. At least, check with me prior to forming an opinion.
