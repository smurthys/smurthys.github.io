## Engagement: Term Projects

I ocassionally entertain students for term projects. To assure quality, I am quite selective about both
projects and students. My participation in projects is serious and I expect students to be
equally invested, be genuinely interested in learning all parts of project management, and
practice "social coding". Bottom line, the projects are not "resume enhancement" exercises.

Students typically work on parts of one of my ongoing projects. I am open to new project ideas
in areas of my interest. It's unlikely I will be interested in projects about buzzwords.

During the project, students will experience first-hand all aspects of project/product management
using many of the same tools and processes used in the industry. Students who complete projects
under me generally become preferred candidates with many employers, and practically all students
attribute their success in finding and maintaining jobs to the overall experience. These levels
of achievement are possible only with discipline and commitment on the part of both the students
and myself.

Interested students should speak with their admins and faculty, and have them send me
strong recommendations. Naturally, to accept recommendations, I need to already have a
working relationship with the recommender. If a relationship does not exist, engaging me for
one or more talks at the institution is a common way to start the relationship.
